= Getting Started =
All JAASmine use cases share a few fundamental requirements:
== create a kerberos account ==
(using active directory users and computers administration application)

*NOTE:* when needing to use encryption type des-cbc-md5, you should create a user account rather than a computer account, as this cannot be set for a computer type account

== create a keytab ==
(using ktpass utility at windows command line):

{{{ktpass -princ HTTP/machine-name.yourdomain.edu@AD.YOURDOMAIN.EDU -mapuser YOURREALM\service-username$ -mapop set +rndPass -out s:\path-to-file\service-username.keytab -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT}}}

*NOTE:* to specify a password, use the -pass parameter (followed by the password), rather than using the +rndPass parameter, which randomly generates one.
